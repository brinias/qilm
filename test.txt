U: Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ?
B: You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness .

U: What do you mean ? It will help us to relax .
B: Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ?

U: I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home .
B: I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends .

U: That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them .
B: Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too .

U: Good.Let ' s go now .
B: All right .

U: Can you do push-ups ?
B: Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute .

U: Really ? I think that's impossible !
B: You mean 30 push-ups ?

U: Yeah !
B: It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too .

U: Can you study with the radio on ?
B: No , I listen to background music .

U: What is the difference ?
B: The radio has too many comerials .

U: Are you all right ?
B: I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire .

U: Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。
B: I see .

U: Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ?
B: Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates .

U: What position do you play ?
B: I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense .

U: Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself .
B: Oh , yeah ? Which team ?

U: The Rockets .
B: Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later .

U: Hey Lydia , what are you reading ?
B: I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling !

U: What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ?
B: It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ?

U: January 5th .
B: Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers !

U: That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense .
B: No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize .

U: Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ?
B: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you !

U: Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ?
B: Is he really ?

U: Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .
B: Who is he marring ?

U: A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .
B: Have they set a date for the wedding ?

U: I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs .
B: That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market .

U: What kind of house is it ?
B: It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style .

U: Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses .
B: And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price .
